Running the CNN with basic structure follow these steps:

1) Install the TensorFlow.

2) Divide the images with the original size into two or more classes based on the aim of classification (e.g. discrimination of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell lung cancer as two classes).

3) 70% of images should be selected as Train (train and validation) and 30% as Test sets. Therefore, the name of images as well as their path should be save as .txt files.

4) The CNN algorithm should be run on the Train set images using shell script. 

5) The trained algorithms should be tested using Load.py on Test set images. 

6) The accuracy can be measured using acc.py or other measurement codes.

7) The plot can be illustrated using plot illustration codes.
